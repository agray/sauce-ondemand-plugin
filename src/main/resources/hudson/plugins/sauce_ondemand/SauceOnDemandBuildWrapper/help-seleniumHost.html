<div>
	If the <em>Enable Sauce Connect?</em> checkbox is selected, then the SELENIUM_HOST and SELENIUM_PORT varaiables will default to localhost:4445.  if the checkbox is not set, then the SELENIUM_HOST and SELENIUM_PORT variables will be set to ondemand.saucelabs.com:4444.  If you have a dedicated Sauce Connect instance running elsewhere, you can override that here.
